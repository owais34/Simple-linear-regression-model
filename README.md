# Simple-linear-regression-model
Implementation of a simple linear regression model for a dataset with single feature

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
First of all you need to get the latest version of python up and running in your system.
You can chose between R and Python for implementing and using ML algorithms.However I prefer python because of its popularity

Just go through the steps on this site , everything is mostly self explanatory.

If you are working on an ipython notebook you'll need to have numpy,pandas and matplotlib installed.
